# Los-Angeles-Crime-Analysis

OBJECTIVE:
The objective is to visualize the data for different set of features and create forecasting models for police to forecast crimes and build predictive models to alert the public with different set of crime that could possibly occur.

CRIME SAGE is a predictive model that predicts the most probable crimes that could happen to a person based on features like their age, sex, descent, time, day and the location they are heading.
